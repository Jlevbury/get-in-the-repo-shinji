## Description
This group project tasked us to utilize everything we have collectively learned in the first 6 weeks of bootcamp.  At the start of the group assignment, our team came together and discussed what hobbies or topics we have in common. This was done in order to find a common ground that we could discuss content and features with an understanding of what the materials discussed were exactly.  Discussion led to the decision that an app that made content discovery tools for Anime and Manga available to the user. Built around the user stories below, we built the foundation of "Anime Sensei"

AS an fan of Anime and Manga, I would like to get detailed information about a specific series.
SO that, I can search a specific recommended title and see if the details suit my taste.

AS an anime fan , I want to be able to find recommendations for  titles and genres I have not seen.
SO that , I can explore the library of anime to find new interests.

AS an anime fan, I do not always have time to watch, and would like to read manga.
SO I want to find Manga titles about my favorite animes or genres like them, that I can bring a manga with me to read.




## Learning Experience
During the process of completing this project, we encountered a few bumps in the road in our initial connectivity to the My Anime List API , the official documentation is slightly too vague for novice programmers to make good use of. While requests were getting responses from the API , implementation of the content returned or specific queries returned errored results. After using a 3rd party API host, these issues were immediately remedied and work was able to proceed according to plan. 

Our initial planning involved "plan b" approaches to implementation items if they would not work, so that we would have predetermined routes to keep the flow of progress moving forward, this upfront discussion and planning paid dividends when the development of page content was underway.

Also using the Bulma CSS framework for styling was a learning experience in itself, while it shares similiar approaches to bootstrap in its functionality, it has its own set of modularity commands that require a somewhat strict adherence to the heirachy of elements for building the content, at times this was difficult in getting design layouts to match what was envisioned by the team.
