## Description
This group project tasked us to utilize everything we have collectively learned in the first 6 weeks of bootcamp.  At the start of the group assignment, our team came together and discussed what hobbies or topics we have in common. This was done in order to find a common ground that we could discuss content and features with an understanding of what the materials discussed were exactly.  Discussion led to the decision that an app that made content discovery tools for Anime and Manga available to the user. Built around the user stories below, we built the foundation of "Anime Sensei"

AS a fan of Anime and Manga, I would like to get detailed information about a specific series.
SO that, I can search a specific recommended title and see if the details suit my taste.

AS a anime fan , I want to be able to find recommendations for  titles and genres I have not seen.
SO that , I can explore the library of anime to find new interests.

AS a anime fan, I do not always have time to watch, and would like to read manga.
SO I want to find Manga titles about my favorite animes or genres like them, that I can bring a manga with me to read.
